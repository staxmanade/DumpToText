What is this?
--
If you've ever seen [LinqPAD](http://www.linqpad.net/) and used the `.Dump()` extension method. Then you'll get the idea behind this project.

Its goal is to try to give a quick extension method to allow you to visually trace out the state of (hopefully any) object.

Where would I use this?

Probably the best use case of this would be when doing some TDD. If you want to quickly trace/dump out what an object looks like in memory and have a quick visual read of its public state, then you can leverage this project to help with that.
